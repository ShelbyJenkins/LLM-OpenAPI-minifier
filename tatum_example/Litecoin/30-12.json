call\nsend ltc to blockchain addresses\nlitecoin transactions are based on utxos utxo stands for unspent transaction output a utxo is the amount of ltc that remains at a litecoin address after a cryptocurrency transaction involving this address has been performed the utxo can then be used as input for a new cryptocurrency transaction for more information about the utxo see the bitcoin user documentation to check utxos in a transaction see the api for getting information about a transaction output utxo in a litecoin transaction\nyou can build a ltc transaction by one of the following methods\n\nsending ltc from blockchain addressesthe assets are sent from a list of addresses for each address the last 100 transactions are scanned for any utxo to be included in the transaction for easier control over the assets to be sent we recommend that you use this method only if you have one address to send the assets from to use this method use the ltctransactionaddress or ltctransactionaddresskms schema of the request body\nsending ltc from utxosthe assets are sent from a list of utxos each utxo is included in the transaction use this method if you want to manually calculate the amount to send to use this method use the ltctransactionfromutxo or ltctransactionfromutxokms schema of the request body\n\nwhen an utxo is entered into a transaction the whole utxo amount is included and must be spent for example address a receives two transactions t1 with 1 ltc and t2 with 2 ltc a transaction that consumes the utxos from both t1 and t2 will have an available amount of 3 ltc to spend1 ltc from t1  2 ltc from t2  3 ltc to spend in total\nyou can send the assets to one or multiple recipients in one transaction if you send the assets to multiple addresses each address must have its own amount to receive\npaying the gas fee and receiving the change\nwhen the amount that the recipients should receive is lower than the amount from the utxos the difference between these two amounts is by default used as the gas fee for the transaction because this amount may be considerable and you may not want to spend it all on the gas fee you can explicitly specify the fee amount and the blockchain address where any extra funds remaining after covering the fee will be sent the fee and changeaddress parameters in the request body correspondingly\nsigning a transaction\nwhen sending ltc you are charged a fee for the transaction and you must sign the transaction with the private key of the blockchain address from which the fee will be deducted\nproviding the private key in the api is not a secure way of signing transactions because the private key can be stolen or exposed your private keys should never leave your security perimeter you should use the private keys only for testing a solution you are building on the testnet of a blockchain\nfor signing transactions on the mainnet we strongly recommend that you use the tatum key management system kms and provide the signature id instead of the private key in the api alternatively you can use the tatum javascript client\nexamples of using this endpoint with the tatum js sdk can be found in tatum
